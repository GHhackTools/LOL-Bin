# Understanding OS by making it

### Information

At the time of making this note, I have decided to learn Operating System and tiny development of operating system using Assembly, C Languages.I'm willing to learn about computer stuff that are web development, security, binary exploitation and many more for 'FUN'. After going through this stuff, I knew that we need to understand how its work first.Now I have some spare time and have to do nothing special .So, I have decided to learn Operating System by making my one.However, this is just a note.If you want to read details for Operating System concepts, I recommend the links under Books Section.

Thanks
